# Global-Game-Jam-2018-Game
This game was created within the global game jam 2018 in the theme of Transmission. This game i only a prototype and was created in 48 hours by myself. This was also my first ever experience using Unity.

To run the game simply download the files within the repository and go into the full game folder and run the .exe file.

Disclaimer: DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THE ASSET FOLDERS WITHIN THE FULL GAME FOLDER OTHERWISE THE GAME WONT WORK.
